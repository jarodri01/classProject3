1) This should be a React app based off of Create React App
2) Redux should be used to handle the state in your app related directly to the "todos" (e.g. todos list, filter selection etc.)
3) The app should contain at least two views: /todos and /contact
4) When a user navigates to /todos, they should be presented with a view that:

Display a list of the todo items currently contained in the Redux store
Displays a form (text input and submit button) that allows users to add a new item to the list
Offers a way for a task to be marked as "completed" and clearly indicates this status visually (e.g. strike-through effect)
Offers a way for a task to be removed from the list
Offers a way to view either
all todos
completed todos
incomplete todos
When todos are added/updated/marked as complete, these changes should immediately be reflected in your Redux store (visible via Redux DevTools)

5) When a user navigates to /contact, they should be presented with a view that:

Displays a contact form that displays the following fields
first name field
last name field
email field
comments field
Renders a the form as a controlled component such that after entering text into any of the fields, the form's state has changed (see last screenshot for an example)
6) There should be at least 10 custom CSS rules used throughout the components of your React app
7) You must have a horizontal nav bar at the top of your site
8) You must have at least one example of content side-by-side (e.g. the "new todo" form in the example screenshot)
